<title>DOMINO's Materials</title>
<h1>DOMINO's Article: Data and Software Repository</h1>
<p>This page contains the software and the datasets used to accomplish the experiments presented in the paper 
  "Discovering Relaxed Functional Dependencies based on Multi-attribute Dominance", 
  by Loredana Caruccio, Vincenzo Deufemia, Felix Naumann, and Giuseppe Polese, 
  submitted for publication to IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING. 
  In particular, this page contains the DOMINO algorithm and the re-implemented versions of DD discovery algorithms presented by Song et al. in [1]. </p>
<p> This <a href="README.txt">link</a> allows to download a compressed file (zip format) containing the following files:
  <ul>
    <li>the jar file concerning the module for preparing the input for DOMINO 
      and DD's algorithms (<h5 style="font-family:courier;">CreateMatrix.jar</h5>)</li>
    <li>the jar file concerning the implementation of DOMINO (<h4 style="font-family:courier;">Domino.jar</h4>) </li>
    <li>the jar file concerning the re-implementations of DD discovery algorithms (<h4 style="font-family:courier;">DD.jar</h4>) </li>
    <li>the datasets used for the comparison</li>
    <li>a readme file explaining how to use the software for replicating the experiments</li>
</ul>
